DConf profiles on Debathena

Debathena ships a DConf profile named "athena_user", which is intended
largely to mirror the existing "user" profile, as well as include some
Athena default settings.  It also specifies a new user-db entry named
"user.$CODENAME" where $CODENAME is the output of "lsb_release -sc".
Therefore, there will be separate dconf user profiles for precise,
trusty, etc.  These are populated from a previous profile on first login
to the new distribution, or from the default profile ("user") if no
previous Athena ones are available.

If you wish to manage your DConf profile manually, you should create the
file ".config/debathena/skip_dconf_config".  You can then set
DCONF_PROFILE as you please.  Note that unless you take special action,
you may suffer from backwards compatibility problems if you log in to an
older release using the DConf profile from a newer release.  (At the
time of this writing, the Unity Launcher is known to misbehave.)
